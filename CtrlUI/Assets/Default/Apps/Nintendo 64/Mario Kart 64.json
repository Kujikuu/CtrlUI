It is the first game in the series to use three-dimensional graphics, however, the characters and items in this game are still two-dimensional, pre-rendered sprites. The game offers two camera angles and three engine sizes: 50cc, 100cc and 150cc. Each kart has distinctive handling, acceleration and top speed capabilities. Shells that you fire at rival racers, Bananas that make them skid out and Lightning Bolts that make them small and very slow are just a few of the game's unique power-ups.","tags":[1,35,268435466,268435470,536870937,536871192,536871193,536871208,536871931,536871958,536871969,536871987,536872293,536872352,536872590,536872594,536872622,536872656,536872695,536872983,536873024,536873064,536873186,536873327,536873671,536874539,536874743,536874824,536874900,536875056,536875058,536875059,536875069,536875073,536875074,536875082,536875091,536875098,536875122,536875123,536875128,536875155,536875186,536875198,536875206,536875215,536875233,536875236,536875245,536875262,536875271,536875303,536875392,536875421,536875434,536875481,536875569,536875590,536875606,536875659,536875670,536875672,536875715,536875819,536875822,536875906,536875941,536875955,536876083,536876108,536876214,536876266,536876274,536876318,536876419,536876465,536876470,536876514,536876524,536876551,536876616,536876671,536876698,536876713,536876788,536876790,536876855,536876899,536876927,536877050,536877051,536877052,536877066,536877086,536877088,536877090,536877097,536877103,536877104,536877106,536877116,536877118,536877119,536877120,536877121,536877280,536877627,536877677,536877710,536877736,536877744,536877938,536877982,536878019,536878132,536878217,536878434,536878464,536878545,536879044,536879099,536879791,536879987,536880187,536880441,536881348,536881661,536882021,536882099,536882290,536882347,536882829,536883082,536884033,536884403,536886965],"themes":[1,35],"time_to_beat":0,"total_rating":81.9459036168308,"total_rating_count":314,"updated_at":1592006400,"url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mario-kart-64","version_parent":0,"videos":[35661],"websites":[7506,112678]}
